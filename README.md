# AOSA-NOTES

Notes and implementations of the systems/tools described in the AOSA books (http://aosabook.org).

I'll be slowly working through these, taking some notes and trying to implement all or a subset of them.

## Books:
- [ ] 500 Lines or Less
- [ ] The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Vol I
- [ ] The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Vol II
- [ ] The Performance of Open Source Applications
